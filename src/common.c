/* 
 * wg_split: split a line into segments, using whitespace-sequences as separators.
 *
 * ARGUMENTS:
 * - result:
 *
 *  After the split, this array contains pointers to the start of each
 *  detected segment. Must be preallocated and at least as large as
 *  maxsegments. The pointers point into the dest buffer.
 *
 * - dest:
 *
 *  String into which result points as an index. Must be preallocated, and
 *  at least as big as src. You can use src as dest, but in that case src
 *  is overwritten!
 *
 * - src:
 *
 *  The string to split. Sequences of whitespace are treated as separators, unless
 *  escaped. There are two ways to escape: by using single quotes (anything
 *  between single quotes is treated as one segment), or by using a backslash
 *  to escape the next character. The backslash escape works inside quotation
 *  as well.
 *
 *  Example:
 *
 *  "It\'s   very\ easy   'to  use WiseGuys\' wg_split()' function" is split into:
 *
 *  "It's"
 *  "very easy"
 *  "to  use WiseGuys' wg_split()"
 *  "function"
 *
 * - maxsegments:
 *
 *  The maximum number of segments. If the splitter runs out of segments,
 *  the remainder of the string is stored in the last segment.
 *
 * RETURN VALUE:
 * The number of segments found.
